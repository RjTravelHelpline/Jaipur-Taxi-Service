    review:
      'We spent 2 wonderful weeks travelling in Delhi, Agra and Himachal Pradesh with the most kind and skilled driver, Raghu Choudhary. He took extreme care of our comfort and safety, was absolutely professional and he made us feel like home. The whole itinerary was properly planned to accommodate all our requests and the service provided by the agency was 24.7, every time we needed them. All in all, an amazing experience and made our first time in India impeccable.',

      'We had a great trip to Rajasthan and all thanks to Rajasthan travel help line. We covered sight seeing at Jaipur, Jodhpur and Udaipur with the respective guides who enlightened us regarding the places we visited. A guide is a must to understand all the details may it be regarding palaces or museum artifacts which were included in our tour package.',

      'Discover India Tour. A chance to experienc our culture , heritage , ancient art, Cuisine, history',
    review:
      "Our 'Discover India' tour was an amazing experience. A chance to know our traditions, culture, heritage, history etc. Hospitality shown by Rajasthan people was incomparable. Every person was polite, friendly , helpful. RTH's arrangement was excellent. Hotel's in all Locations, Pushkar, Ajmeer, Jaipur , Agra & Delhi Was very nice heritage hotels. But Hotel at Udaipur was not so good. Driver Mr.Kamalesh was very good person, we felt safe and secure with him. Pushkar was peacefulness & provided meditation feeling. Udaipur was with elegant Forts & Palaces. Pichola lake and boat ride to lake palace was unforgettable experience. Pink City & Hawa mahal at Jaipu was really a different experience. Definitely Thajmahal was the highlight of our tour At Delhi , visit to India Gate, Jan Pat, PM Museum (Jawaharlal Nehru Museum ) and Canaught Place and Mahathama Gandhi samadi at Raj ghat were too informative a place we were longed to visit Altogether our 7 day tour was an exciting experience for our family. Thanks Rajasthan Travel helpline",
